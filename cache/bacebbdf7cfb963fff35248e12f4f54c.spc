        <p>It is neither unreasonable nor dishonorable to be as cynical as possible when evaluating the official rationale for going to war--or continuing one.</p>

<p>President Obama, plausibly, believes very little <a href="http://www.newser.com/taggrid/46296/president-obama-speech.html">of what he said last night</a> about why we should continue to be in Afghanistan--that we could successful prosecute it, that he could get the Afghans to take ultimate responsibility for it, and that Afghanistan isn't Vietnam. As likely, he believes he has inherited a hopeless mess which, politically--facing censure from both right and left--he must thread a needle to get out of. </p>

<p>His strategic bows to both sides of the debate--committing significantly more troops and at the same time outlining a timetable for bringing them home--indicates that he sees this in both PR as well as military terms. Is it possible that his military goals are entirely in service to his PR goals? This would be morally reprehensible--that soldiers might be expended not to achieve military victory, but to keep a politician in office--but war, of course, is morally reprehensible.</p>

<p>The military strategy he is borrowing--the surge--he borrows from one of the least successful commanders-in-chief in American history. This is a strategy that, arguably, accomplished significantly greater PR goals than military ones, suppressing the most newsworthy violence while doing little to diminish the enemy's underlying position and power.<br />

<p>Few things harm a relationship more than an affair. Whether the affair is emotional, a 'one night stand' or full blown, the betrayal delivers a life altering blow. Will the injury to the relationship prove fatal?</p>

<p>In my experience as a relationship counselor there are some essential steps a couple must take to survive an affair, individually and together. If done wisely, there is hope the relationship will come through the ordeal stronger than before.</p>

<p><strong>1. End the affair immediately.</strong> Kindly, completely, utterly. This has to come first if you are serious about reconciliation. 'Friendship' is not an option.</p>

<p><strong>2. Re-commit to the relationship.</strong>  If either of you aren't sure about staying together then, for God's sake, say so! Confusion is OK just don't let that be an excuse to avoid talking about the reality.</p>

<p><strong>3. Full disclosure.</strong> If your partner wants to know the details you owe them the details. Help them understand the reality because believe me, as bad as it is, it isn't as bad as what your partner is imagining. Sometimes they really don't want to know. Fine, let them tell you that directly. Don't assume it.</p>

<p><strong>4. Stop running and face the pain.</strong>  Avoiding pain is often what led to the affair in the first place.  Facing it is terrifying but necessary. Just shut up and listen; take courage and talk.</p>

<p><strong>5. Walk on hot coals.</strong> Express your remorse and sincerely say that you will do whatever it takes to re-focus on the relationship. Then do it.</p>

<p><strong>6. Take responsibility.</strong> Resist assigning blame. The affair is a symptom of something very wrong in the relationship. Both parties need to dig deep to discover and accept their share of responsibility. If the real issues aren't addressed nothing has changed.</p>

<p><strong>7. Forgiveness.</strong>  Everyone involved needs forgiveness in order to heal. Both parties are injured, both parties are grieving, both parties need forgiveness.</p>

<p>A good relationship counselor can help you negotiate these steps, and more, steps that may be unique to your particular situation. This is just the beginning. To fully heal you need... </p>

<p><strong>8. Time.</strong> Once injured, trust is like those tiny flowers that manage to live in the harsh environment of the tundra. Protect it, cherish it and with time something that once appeared so vulnerable will turn into something beautiful and incredibly strong with deep, sturdy roots.</p>

I am the Eric Burns who used to host "Fox News Watch" on the right-wing partial-news-but-mostly-opinion network.  In the past year and a half, since departing from Ailes and friends, I have been much more silent about media matters than my namesake.</p>

<p>       I speak out now because it is the time of year when one is supposed to count blessings.  I have several.  Among them is that I do not have to face the ethical problem of sharing an employer with Glenn Beck.</p>

<p>       Actually, Beck is a problem of taste as well as ethics.  He laughs and cries; he pouts and giggles; he makes funny faces and grins like a cartoon character; he makes earnest faces yet insists he is a clown; he cavorts like a victim of St. Vitus's Dance.  His means of communicating are, in other words, so wide-ranging as to suggest derangement as much as versatility.</p>

<p>       He is Huey Long without the political office.</p>

<p>       He is Father Coughlin without the dour expression.</p>

<p>       He is John Birch without the Society.</p>

<p>       He is an embarrassment to all true conservatives, men and women who believe sincerely, thoughtfully and sensibly that the role of government in American life should be limited. </p>

<p>       Of course, Beck does not call himself a conservative; he is, rather, a libertarian, which may be defined as a conservative-squared, a person who wants the feds to collect no money in taxes, spend no money on programs, but make available all services that the libertarian deems necessary for his own convenience and safety.</p>

<p>       It is remarkable that Beck has attracted the amount of attention he has.  Remarkable because, every night, Fox's Sean Hannity and MSNBC's Keith Olbermann stage a duel of one-sidedness in political commentary that would have been the talk, and the shame, of a more civil era. </p>

<p>       Remarkable because, every night, Fox's Bill O'Reilly stages an exhibition of contentiousness, mean-spiritedness and self-aggrandizement that would similarly have affronted civil viewers of the past.</p>

<p>       Remarkable because, every night, CNN's Campbell Brown stages an exhibition of a different kind, one of honorable pugnacity, an exhibition that would have stimulated viewers of the past but instead makes her a part of her network's continuing decline in prime-time ratings.</p>

<p>       Yet Glenn Beck surpasses them all.  He is the talk of the talkers.  It is he who causes commentators to comment, fans to swoom, foes to fulminate.  And it is he who has motivated me to burrow up from my literary researches to opine on journalism one more time.</p>

<p>       I ask myself what I would have done if I worked at Fox now.  Would I have quit, as the estimable Jane Hall did?  Once a panelist on my program, Hall departed for other reasons as well, but Beck was a particular source of embarrassment to her, even though they never shared a studio, perhaps never even met.</p>

<p>       I think . . . I think the answer to my question does not do me proud.  I think, more concerned about income than principle, I would have continued to work at Fox, but spent my spare time searching avidly for other employment.  I think I would not have been as admirable as Jane Hall.  I think I would not have reacted to Beck with the probity I like to think I possess.</p>

<p>       But, in my defense, I would never have gone out in public without wearing those funny black eyeglasses with no glass, bushy eyebrows and a fake nose.</p>

        <p>The most recent Gallup Poll on what Americans think is the best way to create jobs is a bit disheartening because it flies in the face of basic economics. Protectionism is the number one way Americans believe more jobs can be created.&#160; This was true for Republicans, Independents and Democrats. The data suggest that the Obama Administration is in touch with what people want as the President has certainly <a href="http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2009/11/buy-american-horror-stories-in-canada.html">shown protectionist mettle</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://images.creditwritedowns.com/2009/12/jobs-poll-2009-12-02.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="jobs-poll-2009-12-02" border="0" alt="jobs-poll-2009-12-02" src="http://images.creditwritedowns.com/2009/12/jobs-poll-2009-12-02.png" width="484" height="288" /></a> </p>

<p>The phrasing of the top answers was "keep manufacturing jobs in the U.S" and "lower taxes." Gallup titled the article "<a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/124538/Americans-See-Protectionism-Tax-Cuts-Ways-Create-Jobs.aspx?CSTS=tagrss">Americans See Protectionism, Tax Cuts as Ways to Create Jobs</a>." This seems accurate although I should note that there was a question asking whether we should use more "Buy American" measures to protect jobs and fewer respondents wanted this.&#160; So, Americans are not calling for protectionism of the Smoot-Hawley variety.</p>

<p>On other issues, notice the shift in priorities between Democrats and Republicans on tax cuts, regulation, and infrastructure projects.&#160; I interpret this dichotomy as demonstrating Republicans favouring lower taxes and less regulation to help small business.&#160; Think Joe the Plumber. Democrats back more direct job creation measures.</p>

<p>President Obama is trying to take a middle road in part to mollify blue dog Democrats in Congress in the lead up to 2010 mid-term elections. Given the polling data, I do not anticipate his administration will favour direct jobs creation as the primary means of creating jobs. However, I believe that the economy will stall without this direct job creation and this will mean a major defeat for Democrats in 2010, making Congress more hostile to the Administration's priorities.</p>

<p>As for protectionism, Obama has shown repeatedly that he is not a free-trader. Back in January, the dean of free trader <a href="http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2009/01/jagdish-bhagwati-obama-is-a-protectionist.html">Jagdish Bhagwati called Obama a protectionist</a>. I have begun to share that view.&#160; The data show that this is how Americans want their President to act. I believe China is the likely target of any protectionism in the U.S. </p>

<p>But protectionism is sub-optimal. All economists agree; even liberals like Paul Krugman say so.&#160; Nonetheless, Krugman is on record favouring <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/protectionism-and-stimulus-wonkish/">protectionism as a "second-best argument</a>. He sees a <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/more-on-protectionism-wonkish/">strong political case for protectionism</a>. And given Obama's previous record, the need to create jobs and the polling data, some sort of protectionism is probably where we are headed.</p>

        <p>In the midst of slow-moving recovery plans, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is one of the only rays of light that American families have seen.  Latino communities continue to struggle with unemployment and foreclosure.  In 2009 alone, more than 700,000 Hispanic and Black borrowers are expected to lose their homes to foreclosure.  The FHA could be a strong, vital force in stabilizing the housing market, particularly for low-income borrowers. </p>

<p>Though not without its share of past challenges, FHA has long been a standard-bearer of safe home lending for low- and modest-income Americans, first-time homebuyers, and communities of color.  With a powerful set of foreclosure prevention tools, many FHA borrowers are able to preserve their homes from foreclosure.  </p>

<p>What's more, many Latinos are relying on FHA to assist in facilitating their first mortgage.  Millions of Latinos who should be able to take advantage of lower home prices are unable to access credit.  Families--including 45% of Latino homebuyers in 2008--are relying on their FHA mortgage to take advantage of the newly affordable home prices.  </p>

<p>If families who are otherwise qualified and prepared for homeownership are unable to access credit, deep-pocketed investors and speculators will swoop in buying properties for cents on the dollar.  Not only does this keep property values low, it turns stable neighborhoods over to the hands of absentee landlords.</p>

<p>To expedite economic recovery, we need to ratchet up the positive influence of the FHA.  This will be good for both borrowers and taxpayers.  Here are some of the things that we at the National Council of La Raza (NCLR) would like to see happen:</p>

<p>•	Purge the FHA originator of bad apples that scam borrowers and taxpayers.  Lending under the FHA brand is a privilege and it should be closely guarded.</p>

<p>•	Protect FHA product flexibility.  Now is not the time to mess with a good thing.  Rather, make it harder to qualify for an FHA loan.  FHA should create an incentive in the form of a premium discount if a borrower attends pre-purchase housing counseling from a HUD-approved agency.</p>

<p>•	Make sure all FHA borrowers get the foreclosure prevention service they are entitled to.  Servicers should not be able to file a complaint against the insurance fund unless they prove that they exhausted all options to save the home from foreclosure.</p>

<p>Stabilizing the housing market is a critical step on the road to economic recovery.  The housing market cannot be rehabilitated though, unless borrowers feel safe and have access to fair credit.  For this reason, we must prevent the FHA mortgage insurance program from becoming an unwarranted <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/19/AR2009111904742.html">casualty</a> of the meltdown through sweeping legislation.  A stronger, more competitive FHA program could anchor our shaky market and prevent vast loss in a future credit crunch.  </p>

        <p><strong>Voices From Hopenhagen</strong></p>
<p>I have been working to solve global warming for over a decade, and the news I hear from climate scientists has grown increasingly sober and grim. Yet I remain hopeful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I work with people every day--in business, in science, in government--who are deeply committed to solving this crisis. Together, we grasp the urgent need to prevent the worst impacts of global warming, but we also sense the enormous opportunities that will unfold if we commit to building a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.<!--break--></p>
<p>This is the message my colleagues and I will bring to the international climate talks in Copenhagen. These talks remain critically important, even as Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg--obama-climate-qa16-2009nov16,0,6041967.story">proposed</a> the &ldquo;one agreement, two steps&rdquo; approach, which will extend the release of the final, legally binding agreement by a few months.</p>
<p>This approach gives countries a chance to solidify their individual commitments to reduce global warming pollution. This in turn could help push the U.S. Senate to pass its climate law, because if developing nations like China and India announce their pledges for reductions, it sends a clear signal that the United States will not be acting alone.</p>
<p>The sooner the United States and all the nations take action, the sooner we can unleash the opportunities that come with clean energy.</p>
<p>I have been traveling the country lately to talk about my new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Energy-Common-Sense-American/dp/144220317X?tag=nrdc-20">Clean Energy Common Sense</a>, an accessible, concise read--something you could finish on a plane ride or during your commute--about the problem of climate change and how we can solve it.</p>
<p>When I met with reporters in Washington, I got asked a lot of questions about political sparring in the Senate and Copenhagen. But since I left the Beltway behind, the questions have changed. Most people want to know about one thing: jobs, jobs, and jobs.</p>
<p>And here is the side of the climate story that often goes untold: the economic growth side.</p>
<p>Pointing the country toward a clean energy future is going to be a big job. It will require the skills of all of us -- carpenters, metal fabricators, tool and dye makers, scientists, truck drivers, software designers, computer engineers and an array of others. People who work with their hands and their minds.</p>
<p>Combined with the economic stimulus package, the clean energy legislation now before the Senate would <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/media/2009/090618.asp">create 1.7 million such jobs</a>, according to a 2009 study by the Political Economy Research Institute at University of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking here about many hundreds of thousands of jobs, spread across all 50 states.  According to the UMass study, Ohio alone could produce almost 70,000 jobs--opportunities for steelworkers, coil winders, and bearing makers who produce components to build wind turbines, electricians who install solar panels, and construction workers who retrofit buildings to cut energy use.</p>
<p>Those estimates, by the way, are based on $150 billion of investments in clean and sustainable energy use. A July <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/electricpowernaturalgas/downloads/US_energy_efficiency_full_report.pdf">report</a> by McKinsey &amp; Co., an international economic consulting firm, showed the country could profitably invest more than $500 billion in energy efficiency upgrades over the coming decade, and get more than $2 in energy savings for every dollar spent.</p>
<p>The economic and job-creation benefits of efficiency have prompted the Obama administration to consider a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/business/economy/18leonhardt.html">cash for caulkers</a>&rdquo; stimulus plan modeled on the highly successful &ldquo;cash for clunkers&rdquo; program. The plan would put construction workers, who have been hit hard by the housing crisis, back to work weatherizing homes.</p>
<p>This is the kind of job growth our nation needs right now. Yet in order to jumpstart it, we need to put policies in place that limit global warming pollution and promote low-carbon technologies.</p>
<p>We need to secure those policies here at home; we need to secure them in Copenhagen. And we need to do it now. Never before have the stakes on this issue been higher. Never before has there been more momentum for change.</p>
<p>Now is the time for citizens to weigh in. Now is the time for people to speak up and tell our leaders that yes, we want to solve global warming. We want to create green jobs, reduce our reliance on dirty fossil fuels, and produce the next generation of clean energy technologies.</p>
<p>The number of voices bringing this message to Washington and Copenhagen is what keeps me hopeful. I encourage you to join the chorus.</p>
<p>Help turn Copenhagen into Hopenhagen at <a href="http://hopenhagen.org/">hopenhagen.org</a>.</p>

        <p><em>Dear Christine,</p>

<p>Since I transitioned from undergrad, I feel as though I've been drinking from a fire hose! New job, new city, new friends, new home, new responsibilities, new challenges. No matter how exhilarating this period can be, it's inevitable that STRESS can creep in at certain times. I realize that life stressors will never back off, take a vacation and say, "Okay, I'll give you a pass this once."  In fact, I welcome the challenge of learning how to manage it. However, it tends to take its toll in waves--some weeks are easier than others. Any advice?<br />
Stressing to de-stress, 22, Washington DC</em></p>

<p>Dear Stressing to De-Stress,</p>

<p>Stress is something that plagues most of us in some way or another.  Learning how to manage stress is hot topic especially during your twenties when there can be quite a lot of transitions and unknowns.  To me, stress is not something to "manage" since managing stress implies that it is still going to be there.  Wouldn't you rather eliminate stress by learning how to respond to it in more life-enhancing ways? </p>

<p>For years I tried to learn how to "manage" stress. I read books, went to yoga classes, scheduled in down time, spent time in nature and so on but I found that there was a huge roadblock to having any of these things be effective stress management techniques: my mind.  Even in the midst of a great hike overlooking a beautiful view my thoughts would wander to my to-do or worry list. Or I'd be so busy that I'd find myself rushing to make it to a yoga class and be even more mentally stressed out by the time I got there!  Instead of trying to manage stress by doing other things, I have found the key is to learn how to RESPOND to stress by making my mind (the true beholder of all stress) my ally rather than my nemesis. </p>

<p>Most stress comes in two forms: anxiety and overwhelm.  Anxiety is when we are stressed about things that have not happened yet, things we are anticipating.  Anxiety is basically future based worrisome thinking.  Overwhelm occurs when there is so much on our plate and our thoughts become burdened with constant to-dos and a sense that we will never catch up.  </p>

<p>When you are experiencing stress you are either anxious or in overwhelm and there are effective ways to respond to each.   Let's tackle anxiety first.  I guarantee you that if you are feeling anxious your mind is in the future. It is impossible to feel anxiety when you are in the present moment; thus, bringing your full attention and awareness to the here and now is the quick-fix to anxiety.  You can do this by paying attention to your breathing, your body, or any other physical experience you are feeling, seeing, tasting, or hearing.  </p>

<p>Staying in the present moment is challenging for all of us, especially when there is a specific thing that you are worried about so I want to also offer you a mental technique that combats anxiety.  Imagine whatever the future event is that you are concerned about in your mind but visualize it going exactly the way you want it to go.  Really bring it to life in your mind; see it, feel it, sense it, and watch it happen in a way that exceeds your best case scenario. Spend about a minute positively and powerfully visualizing the event or circumstance you are stressed about and then project yourself in your mind 15 minutes past the successful completion of the event so that you are now looking back on it.  And now notice what happened to the feeling of anxiety? It will be gone!</p>

<p>Now onto dealing with overwhelm.  We experience this feeling when we have too much vagueness in our mind and we are not focused on specific and immediate action steps. Overwhelm happens when we become so burdened by EVERYTHING that we have a hard time focusing on ANY ONE THING.  The key to responding to overwhelm is a process called chunking down which is breaking down your "everything" into small, manageable parts.  Write down each of the to-do items or things you have hanging over your head and then begin a process of chucking them down vertically from big-picture intangibles to specific tangibles. Let's use the example of getting all your holiday gifting complete by chucking down from most vague and far off in future to the most specific and immediate action step you can take:</p>

<p>•	Being complete with holiday shopping<br />
•	Wrapping gifts <br />
•	Going to specific store on a specific day (repeat until complete)<br />
•	Scheduling in time to shop<br />
•	Making a list of stores I need to go to<br />
•	Online shopping for gifts I can get online <br />
•	Brainstorm gift ideas for each person<br />
•	Making a list of who I have to buy for*</p>

<p>Now we are at a specific, manageable step: *making a list.  As soon as you arrive at this chunked down step, move into action.  Overwhelm begins to disappear as soon as we move out of reaction to our seemingly overwhelming to-do list and into being proactive! Our mind is a lot calmer when we give it something tangible and do-able to focus on. </p>

<p>Another thing to consider when stress comes in is to take a mental vacation by recalling a time when you did feel totally at peace and relaxed.  Instead of the stress taking hold of you, take hold of it.  Reassure yourself that you are capable of letting go of stress even when a lot is going on.  Life will continually throw us curve balls and most of us are in the habit of creating never-tending to-do lists so rather making stress your enemy, accept it and learn how to respond to it.  Instead of always needing a vacation, use your mind to become a master of sending stress away on vacation!</p>

        <p>The headline sounds preposterous, I know.&nbsp; But it's shopping season, a ritual if ever there were one.&nbsp; And Mark Dery, in <a href="http://changeobserver.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=11747">a very provocative essay</a> on dying malls published on the website <em>Change Observer</em>, invokes the notion in his second paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The multi-tiered, fully enclosed mall (as opposed to the strip mall) has been the Vatican of shiny, happy consumerism since it staked its claim on the crabgrass frontier - and the public mind - in postwar America."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea crops up again, even more explicitly, in the 2009 documentary <em>Malls R Us</em> (trailer below), in which an unidentified narrator compares malls not just to Rome but also to Mecca and Jerusalem.&nbsp; The reason, say the film's voices, is that malls are ceremonial centers, places one goes to find fulfillment, "to fill the void," for a "communal experience," the same reasons many go to places of worship.&nbsp; That rings true, actually.</p>

<p>Roger Ebert <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090729/REVIEWS/907299995/-1/RSS">reviewed the film</a> for the <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Is a shopping mall a sacred place? Not a question often asked. The provocative documentary "Malls R Us" seriously argues that malls serve similar functions today that cathedrals, temples, parliaments, arenas and town squares did in earlier times. Then the film slowly works its way around to the possibility that they may be a plague upon the Earth."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ebert reports that <em>Malls R Us</em> takes us to a Montreal project determined to be "the world's first environmentally friendly mall, complete with fully stocked trout streams; [developer Robin Stahl] hopes Al Gore will visit to open it."&nbsp; And, judging by Ebert's commentary, the most disturbing aspects of the film may be the effect of malls on the third world, where thousands of small shops in Delhi are being condemned while a mall goes up in a wilderness preserve, and where the mall has become "essentially the template for a city-state like <a href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/kbenfield/las_vegas_on_steroids_meet_dub.html">Dubai</a>."</p>

<p>Now, of course, the era of the large, enclosed regional shopping mall appears to be over, with far <a href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/kbenfield/rip_the_american_suburban_shop.html">more of them dying</a> than being built.&nbsp; This perhaps gives new meaning to the already-rich symbolism in George Romero's horror classic <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_of_the_Dead">Dawn of the Dead</a></em>, in which scared citizens seek a different sort of sanctuary in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroeville_Mall">Monroeville (Pennsylvania) Mall</a> as zombies enter and roam as much in search of something to do as someone to eat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also now a web site, <em><a href="http://www.deadmalls.com/">deadmalls.com</a></em>, on which you can learn all about these changes taking place in "retail history!" and even purchase <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/deadmalls">"dead malls merchandise."</a></p>
<p><a href="http://changeobserver.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=11747">Dery's essay</a>, which is really very good, is more thoughtful.&nbsp; Here's a particularly good paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The extreme turbulence that hit the American economy in 2008 offers a rare window of opportunity to hit the re-set button on consumer culture as we know it - to re-tool market capitalism along greener, more socially conscious and, crucially, more profoundly satisfying lines. Because an age of repurposing, recycling and retrofitting needn't be a Beige New World of Soviet-style austerity measures. On the contrary, while we'll likely have far fewer status totems in the near future, the quality of our experiential lives could be far richer in diversity, if we muster the political will to make them so. "The most important fact about our shopping malls," the social scientist Henry Fairlie told The Week magazine, "is that we do not need most of what they sell." Animated by the requisite "sense of public purpose," the post-mall, post-sprawl suburbs could be exuberantly heterogeneous Places That Do Not Suck, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edwin11/2524712954/in/set-72157605260546550"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2612/4147795663_22a772cfa6_m.jpg" alt="Rue de la Confederation, Geneva (by: Edwin Lee, creative commons license)" title="Rue de la Confederation, Geneva (by: Edwin Lee, creative commons license)" width="240" height="160" class="image-right" /></a>where food is grown closer to home, cottage industries are the norm and the nowheresville of chain restaurants and big-box retailers and megamalls has given way to local cuisines, one-of-a-kind shops and walkable communities with a sense of place and social cohesion."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's something to aim for, although it's also a lot to expect.&nbsp; I like some shopping just fine, thanks very much, and don't mind the insides of some malls, though even the best ones can be disorienting, way too similar from one to another, and the ugliness and havoc they and their seas of parking lots impose on the landscape is godawful.&nbsp; Real city shopping streets (see photo above of one of my favorites, in Geneva) provide better experiences for both people and the environment.&nbsp; And, I would argue, just as much communal ritual, if that's what we're sometimes after.</p>
<p>Here's the trailer for <em>Malls R Us</em>:</p>

        <p>What does Europe want from the Muslim community?</p>

<p>Well, you got me.</p>

<p>Like a party host who complains that her country cousins aren't mingling with the guests, and then seats them at the children's table at dinnertime, Switzerland, Denmark, and France can't make up their mind about the so-called "Muslim problem."</p>

<p>The French want to ban the burka. Danish newspapers like to poke sticks at Muslims by publishing offensive cartoons. Now, 57 percent of Switzerland's voters <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/29/swiss-ban-minarets-in-sur_n_373172.html">have passed a referendum </a>to ban the construction of minarets on mosques. Yet some European government officials complain, "Why don't Muslims assimilate into our society?"</p>

<p>And I ask: "Why would I want to?"</p>

<p>For all the phony talk about Muslim assimilation into white European Christian society, some EU countries do their best to marginalize us. In Switzerland, about 6 percent of the population is Muslim, a great many who are war refugees from Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. </p>

<p>I agree that it's likely that these first-generation Muslims have difficulty assimilating into European society, but that's true of first-generation immigrants in any country throughout history. Their offspring, however, are a different story. In 20 years time we'll see many second-generation Eastern European Muslims fit right into Swiss society. That is as long as the government resists the temptation to pass discriminatory laws against their right to worship and practice their cultural customs and traditions like everyone else.</p>

<p>There are two troubling aspects of the minaret ban. There is little of the Islamic extremist ideology found in Switzerland that would prompt such discrimination. And the country's constitution essentially prohibits anti-religious laws.</p>

<p>Unlike France and Denmark, there has been little talk of the "Islamification" of Switzerland. There are few burka-clad, dark-skinned Asian Muslim women walking the streets of Geneva and Zurich. Aside from the occasional web rants of extremists, there are no calls for Shariah to replace Swiss laws. There are about 150 mosques in Switzerland, most of which are no more than large prayer rooms. There are no calls for prayer over loudspeakers. Only four mosques have minarets.</p>

<p>So where do these anti-Muslim sentiments come from? I blame the ultra-right wing Swiss People's Party, the junior version of the British National Party and the Dutch Party for Freedom. The Swiss People's Party's clever ad campaign for the referendum featured an advertisement of a scowling burka-clad woman next to sprouting black minarets atop the Swiss flag. It's a compelling image that plays on the fears of the Swiss. </p>

<p>But I also blame European Muslims who allow extremist websites to present a skewed image of Islam. Imams, Islamic scholars, Muslim journalists and social workers do so little to stem the tide of public opinion. European Muslims need to shed their reticence to defend themselves by countering claims of the Islamification of Europe.</p>

<p>A case in point is the October appearance of BNP's Nick Griffin on the BBC's Question Time. Griffin's odious anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim positions were exposed by Muslim and Christian participants on the television show. The exposure demonstrated that BNP's policies were not based on facts and logic, but on hate.</p>

<p>Switzerland's Muslims can remain silent and continue to be marginalized or they can involve themselves in government policy and the media to shape their future. Frankly, I'm a little weary of the namby-pamby "let's not rock the boat" attitude of Muslims. It didn't work for Jews in the 1930s and I don't think it's going to work for Muslims today.</p>

<p>The other uncomfortable aspect of the referendum is that it flies in the face of Switzerland's constitution. The constitution bans discrimination against persons on the "grounds of origin, race, gender, age, language, social position, way of life, religious, ideological, or political convictions, or because of a physical, mental or psychological disability."</p>

<p>Swiss government leaders have indicated they have no choice but to pass the referendum into law. But I sense that the referendum can be challenged on constitutional grounds.  It also should be noted that although a clear majority of Swiss voters want the referendum to be the law of the land, it doesn't mean it's a good law. There's no question that a massive mosque with minarets will look out of place in a neighborhood surrounded by 17th century architecture. But that's a zoning issue decided at the local level. </p>

<p>And that's precisely the reason why this is a referendum that discriminates against one specific religion. The design and construction of a mosque or any building is a decision best left to local districts. By taking the decision out of the hands of local officials and declaring that minarets - not cathedrals or synagogues - should be banned throughout the country changes the issue from one simply of architecture to one of religion.</p>

<p>Switzerland has enjoyed a global reputation as a nation of tolerance and a safe haven for the oppressed. That reputation was rocked in the mid-1990s when it was revealed that Switzerland's banking industry colluded with Nazi Germany to plunder accounts of depositors in occupied countries during World War II. Swiss banks also refused to release the account funds of Holocaust survivors after the war. The controversy greatly upset the Swiss who saw their reputation as a tolerant country impugned.</p>

<p>The Swiss are now facing a new but similar test. Do they join the ranks of Denmark and France in allowing right-wing political groups manipulate its citizens' emotions with unsubstantiated rhetoric? Or do they take the right path by embracing all religions and cultures of people who seek a fair shake when they cross into their borders? <br />

        <p>Need I say it?  Gossip and complaint is not good for our health.  Despite this, complaints and rumor mills are having a field day.  Here, in the Pacific Northwest, rumors abound regarding the suspected killer, Maurice Clemmons, who was killed hours ago, after gunning down four police in service to our community this past Sunday.  On other fronts, Mike Huckabee has become a target for verbal sharp-shooters with their criticisms that he 'should have known.'  Meanwhile, Tiger Woods is surrounded in Technicolor speculation and gossip mongering about his own private life after crashing his car into a tree sometime after 2 a.m.near his home.  As for President Obama, he is receiving his own 'day in (complaint) court' by Republicans and Democrats following his speech at Westpoint regarding the new Afghanistan strategy for our troops.</p>

<p>The question is what result does criticizing leave in its wake?  Since criticizing, complaining, and gossiping are anything but solution-oriented, they bring destruction, not solution.  You can always tell a habitual complainer from the rest of the pack because when you ask him 'what's the solution,' he will not have an answer.  So much easier to condemn than collaborate in healing the hurt that ails us.</p>

<p>What seduces us into these counterproductive activities with the rest of the herd?  The fact is that we are most susceptible when we are "living lives of quiet desperation," as Thoreau put it so well.  When we lack a compass, vitality, and purpose, it's easy to get lost.  The real problem is that when we do not know where we are going, either as a people, or as individuals, it is much safer to get into commentary about other people's lives and maps than it is to face the anxiety of the unknown.  It fills the time.  </p>

<p>What's another way?  By way of contrast, the lives of our greatest teachers take quite a different direction.  Take the Dalai Lama, for example.  Exiled from his native Tibet, he moves forward into what is foreign.  Walking such an edge leaves little room for meddling in other people's lives.  Such a choice leaves neither room for past attachments and comforts, nor courting the anxiety of the not-yet-here.  Instead, His Holiness, the Dalai Lama started where he was.  He attended the moment. He practiced locating the Stillness in the moment, and has always made his contribution from the discipline of being fully Present, finding compassion from this place.  In his words this summer:</p>

<blockquote>...the mind always looks out critically and deals with external events, but rarely bothers about itself.  Therefore, we have to give it new instructions.  Up to now, you have dealt with what's going on outside; that's well and good, but now the time has come to explore within and find out more about the mind itself.  In doing so, we also have to make an effort to restrain the way our thoughts follow memories of the past and speculations about the future.  We need to find the space between such thoughts, which like the water deep in the ocean, remains clear and undisturbed even though there may be waves on the surface.  This is one way to look at the mind itself; it's not easy, but I think it is worthwhile to try... -- the Dalai Lama in <em>Be the Change</em></blockquote>

<p>A Time for New Instruction.  Today, his words remind us of treasure that's to be gained by returning focus to the inner landscape, rediscovering the Stillness beneath the ripples on the surface of our mind...even during the toughest times of accusation without the benefit of being presumed innocent, until proven guilty.    The good news about difficult times like these is that whatever brouhaha is brewing in our lives, it is but another invitation to come home to what really matters in the quiet of the moment.  So, if you are a Tiger Woods figure, a super-achiever who's being condemned by jury-less rumor mills, or a 'Mike Huckabee' who's found guilty of not being sufficiently telepathic to change the future, take heart.  There is hope.  We have choice.  We can look to the outer world, hoping to score highest on its fickle applause-o-meter, or we can find what Jesus called:<br />
			<br />
		"...the peace that passes all understanding..."<br />
		"...the Truth that sets you free..."</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The Three Steps of New Instruction.</strong></p>

<p>Join the21 Day Challenge:</p>

<p>For the next 21 consecutive days, do the following, and enjoy the process.  This is the best preparation I know to enjoy the holidays as never before!  By practicing these instructions, you will smile more, relax more, and relocate your sense of humor.  Your family will like you more.  You will enjoy those you know, and do not know even more.  New creative inspiration will come your way.  You will notice new streams of abundance moving in your direction.  Ah, but first, the practice:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong>	Every morning and before you go to sleep:  Lay down your burden.  Breathe in and breathe out, until you find the deepest center of relaxation beneath the ripple of your thoughts, the worries of the day, and the concerns of what someone else might think.  As Terry Cole-Whitacre said it years ago: "What you think of me is none of my business!"  What does matter is letting all this go, until you arrive at the destination called 'gratitude.'  Thank whatever is beyond your ego for another day of life, another opportunity to participate in Creation.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong>    Contract with a partner of your choice to participate in this 21 day challenge, someone you'd enjoy checking in with for two minutes a day<br />
so that you can share your report of what you are noticing.  This is a crucial step.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong>	     Over the next 21 days DO NOT Complain, Gossip, Criticize.  You<br />
	     Will be living in a Complaint-free zone.  Keep watch.  Self-interrupt <br />
	When you go forget.  Forgive yourself, and start over, this day becoming<br />
	Day #1.  If you stay true to the process, and forgive yourself as needed,<br />
	Be assured the results will warrant your practice.  Have a ball.</p>

<p>On those days which are more challenging, cleave to the words of the poet Mary Oliver:</p>

<blockquote>You don't have to be good.  
You don't need to crawl on your knees through the desert
for a hundred miles repenting.  
All you need to do is love the small furry creature inside yourself...</blockquote>

<p>Let me know how it goes.  Let us know what helps you return to a practice of self-forgiveness.  What helps you return to your own Center?  What have you found helpful when someone else is gossiping/complaining/criticizing/draining life energy?  I'm listening!       Thanks for passing this along to your crew, your contacts, and your buddies.  The more the merrier.  Godspeed, Cara</p>

        Charlie Beck, Los Angeles's newly appointed chief of police, is a cop's cop.<p><br>

For a city that's lived through seven years of his rock star predecessor, Bill Bratton -- whose outsized abilities came with an ego to match -- it's a definite change of pace. Beck, 56, is about as rooted in Los Angeles and its police force as a man can be. A 32-year LAPD veteran whose father retired from the force as a deputy chief, he's married to a retired LA County Sheriff, has a daughter serving as a patrol officer out of the department's Hollywood station and a son about to graduate from the Police Academy. Unlike most ambitious LAPD commanders, Beck doesn't have a graduate management degree from USC or Pepperdine -- he majored in vocational arts at California State University Long Beach -- and, for most of his career, has avoided prestigious staff assignments for command jobs in the field.<p>

Still, when Bratton needed somebody to clean up the department's corruption-riddled Rampart Division, he tapped Beck for the assignment. Later he dispatched him to South Los Angeles, where Beck actually made the LAPD popular with African-American community leaders -- while suppressing crime to record levels. When the LAPD's forensics and DNA lab fell years behind in its work, particularly the testing of rape kits, Bratton asked Beck -- by then chief of detectives -- to straighten the mess out and put the lab back in working order, which he did.<p>

When he decided to leave, Bratton made it clear to Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who would name his successor subject to City Council confirmation, that he thought Beck should be the new chief. Watching the Villaraigosa-Beck relationship develop will be a matter of some interest in Los Angeles's political circles. Bratton's success with LAPD has been Villaraigosa's biggest political asset. If, as many expect, he runs for the Senate when his second mayoral term is finished, Villaraigosa is going to need an equal performance from Beck -- something that won't be easy in an era of restricted budgets and growing civic financial distress.<p>

Even when he's fighting off a cold and interview fatigue, as he was when he sat for a conversation with the Huffington Post on a recent afternoon, Beck is low-key, funny and warmly personable.<p>

<strong><p>When people call you chief, what do you think? </p></strong>

<p>It's an amazing honor, but it's also daunting. This city depends on the police department more than most others. </p>
 
<strong><p>So, what's the most pressing issue? </p></strong>

<p>Well, on the administrative side, it's obviously the budget and organizing the department the way it should be. On the law enforcement side, the goal is to continue reducing crime with a focus on gangs. Gang violence in LA is the vast majority of the violence.<p>

<strong>It's been a problems since this place was a pueblo. How do you reduce it? 
</strong><p>

Generally over the last eight years we've been very successful in reducing gang crime. In the last two years, we've cut gang homicides in half. So it can be done. You do it by not just using suppression, not just using cops. You do it by using a broad band of solutions that includes prevention, intervention, suppression and then also re-entry. All those things combined make a difference. Any one of those things by themselves, won't stand alone. </p>

<strong><p>Can you do all that with less money?</p></strong>

<p>We've lost the ability to pay overtime this year, so all overtime will have to be compensatory. It's not a great way to run an organization, but it's understandable. I understand that everyone is suffering this year. So we'll be able to hire to compensate for attrition, which means we won't loose any people. If that continues then I can work with that. </p>

<p>If the police force starts getting smaller, than it's going to be a huge issue for Los Angeles. </p>

<strong><p>Do you think that's a possibility? </p></strong>

<p>It's always a possibility. The budget straits are dire. </p>
 
<strong><p>What's left to do on the federal consent decree? </p></strong>

<p>We've been the released from the responsibility of the consent decree, and now we're working on the transition agreement. The vast majority of the pieces of the consent decree have been met. And we will continue to do that. The consent decree has been in place for eight years now. It's how the majority of officers in the organization have been raised. About 60 percent of our field force has been hired since then. </p>

<strong><p>If you could have a private chat with every officer in the city, what would you tell them? </p></strong>

<p>Police in a constitutional manner, be open, be direct, treat people with respect, do your job. Remember that police work is the one profession where process trumps results. You have to do things right.

You can't let the end justify the means. So if they do that, if they're well led and they're well equipped and they're well-staffed, then the city gets the kind of policing that it deserves. </p>
 
<strong><p>I heard you made a very popular decision by telling the officers they didn't have to wear their ties anymore? Was that a fashion statement? </p></strong>

<p>(He laughs) You used to have to wear your tie every time you wore a long-sleeve shirt. So I just made it optional with the exception of ceremonial events.  In normal day-to-day policing they don't have to wear a tie.<p>

<strong><p>How did you decide to be a police officer? I heard the other option was dirt bike racer? </p></strong>

<p>It wasn't an option because I wasn't good enough. Just like many people who had athletic aspirations as a young man, I wasn't good enough. And that was the bottom  line. So I started looking for other things to do. My dad was a cop, and he was a really good one, so I became involved with the department and I found out how much I loved it. </p>

<strong><p>What do you love most about it? </p></strong>

<p>It's a job where you can make a tremendous difference in people's lives. You can live a life of significance. You can have a huge effect on not only society but also on individuals, and that's what I like about it.  It's a job that's action oriented; there's a physical challenge to it. There's the thrill of the hunt, of course. So all those things appeal. </p>
 
<strong><p>What's it like coming in after a rock star like Bratton? </p></strong>

<p>You know what? Bratton was the exact right guy for his time. And I think I'm the right guy for my time. Whether I'm a warm-up act or not, it's for history to judge, not for me. </p>
 
<p><strong>How is policing in LA different than any other city? </strong></p>

<p>First of all, there's a huge need for policing in LA, the gang issues and all that. But also because the police force is so small relatively. Everything you do is amplified. You can't hide behind huge numbers like you can in New York where you can just throw resources at a problem. I can't always do that. I have to try to be clever rather than overwhelming. So that's one piece. </p>

<p>The other piece is the history of the city is so tied to its police department. The history of LA is about the history of LAPD.  And I think that's a huge piece. </p>

<strong><p>So, I heard you love Langers? </p></strong>

<p>Yeah, I do love Langers. </p>

<strong><p>Are you a Number 19 fan? </p></strong>

<p>No. A half of a number 10 (pastrami with swiss cheese) on rye toast. Ask anybody there. They all know.</p>

        <p>Cross-posted from <a href="http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/cs/2009/12/is_afghanistan_a_problem_of_ca.html">Harvard Business Online</a></p>

<p>A senior manager at <a href="http://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a> once suggested to me that there are two types of challenges in organizations -- capacity problems and complexity problems. Capacity problems are those that require more, fewer or different resources. Complexity problems require new thinking and a creative approach. </p>

<p>For example, increasing market share for your product can often be addressed through additional sales people, or more promotion. It's a question of how many resources to throw at the problem. On the other hand, if the market is changing and different competitors are entering with new value propositions, then throwing more resources at the problem probably won't work. </p>

<p>One of the questions raised by President Obama's speech on Afghanistan last night is whether he is trying to solve a complexity problem with a capacity solution. Adding 30,000 more troops certainly suggests that his military analysts have determined that more resources are needed to secure population centers, train local troops and ward off insurgent forces. It's a logical argument -- more resources will lead to a greater capacity to defend and attack. We'll be able to overwhelm the enemy with far greater resources.</p>

<p>But what if Afghanistan is not a problem of capacity, but a problem of complexity? As most students of Afghanistan have pointed out, the country and the culture are extremely difficult for outsiders to understand. There are strong tribal and local loyalties that far outweigh allegiance to a central government; there are religious and ethnic issues that have to be considered; there is a history of fierce independence and pride in the face of interventions by foreign forces; there is a tenacious adherence to tradition and resistance to change; there is massive poverty and lack of economic opportunity; and there is little experience with successful and non-corrupt democratic institutions. Creating a functioning and effective civil society and government establishment in the face of these issues is a massive complexity challenge -- which means that a capacity solution of more troops may not be sufficient.</p>

<p>Obviously no one knows what the future will bring in Afghanistan. The troop "surge" -- a capacity solution -- seemed to have been helpful in Iraq, although the jury is still out in regard to America's long-term success there. On the other hand, Russia employed a capacity strategy in Afghanistan that proved to be disastrous, as did the U.S. in Vietnam. And no one wants a repeat of those experiences.</p>

<p>The challenge for President Obama in Afghanistan is to make sure that complexity solutions are being deployed along with more troops. In addition to training the Afghan army, will there be training of local school teachers, civil servants, health care workers, and farmers? In addition to securing population centers, will there be securing of jobs, technology, medicines, and infrastructure? In addition to supporting the existing central government, will there be support for local councils, tribal structures, and traditional governance patterns? </p>

<p>Getting foreign troops out of Afghanistan in three years is a laudable "capacity" goal. But leaving a functioning and secure country behind is a much more complex challenge, one that will require new thinking -- not just new resources.</p>

        <p><em>Cross-posted with <a href="http://TomDispatch.com">TomDispatch.com</a>. </em></p>

<p>A few weeks later, when the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended that regular screening mammography not start until age 50, all hell broke loose. Sheryl Crow, Whoopi Goldberg, and Olivia Newton-John raised their voices in protest; a few dozen non-boldface women <a title="http://www.wjla.com/news/stories/1109/680841_video.html?ref=newsstorypicketed" href="http://www.wjla.com/news/stories/1109/680841_video.html?ref=newsstoryhttp://www.wjla.com/news/stories/1109/680841_video.html?ref=newsstorypicketed" target="_blank">picketed</a> the Department of Health and Human Services.&nbsp; If you didn&rsquo;t look too closely, it almost seemed as if the women&rsquo;s health movement of the 1970s and 1980s had returned in full force.</p>

<p>Never mind that Dr. Susan Love, author of what the <em>New York Times</em> dubbed &ldquo;the bible for women with breast cancer,&rdquo; endorses the new guidelines along with leading women&rsquo;s health groups like Breast Cancer Action, the <a href="http://www.stopbreastcancer.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=979&amp;Itemid=169">National Breast Cancer Coalition</a>, and the National Women&rsquo;s Health Network (NWHN). For years, these groups have been warning about the excessive use of screening mammography in the U.S., which carries its own dangers and leads to no detectible lowering of breast cancer mortality relative to less mammogram-happy nations.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, on CNN last week, we had the unsettling spectacle of NWHN director and noted women&rsquo;s health advocate Cindy Pearson speaking out for the new guidelines, while ordinary women lined up to attribute their survival from the disease to mammography. Once upon a time, grassroots women challenged the establishment by figuratively burning their bras. Now, in some masochistic perversion of feminism, they are raising their voices to yell, &ldquo;Squeeze our tits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Stupak anti-choice amendment passed, and so entered the health reform bill, no congressional representative stood up on the floor of the House to recount how access to abortion had saved her life or her family&rsquo;s well-being. And where were the tea-baggers when we needed them? If anything represents the true danger of &ldquo;government involvement&rdquo; in health care, it&rsquo;s a health reform bill that &ndash; if the Senate enacts something similar -- will snatch away all but the wealthiest women&rsquo;s right to choose.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805087494/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20"><img src="http://www.tomdispatch.com/img/brightehrenreich.gif" alt="" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left" /></a>It&rsquo;s not just that abortion is deemed a morally trickier issue than mammography. To some extent, pink-ribbon culture <em>has</em> replaced feminism as a focus of female identity and solidarity. When a corporation wants to signal that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;woman friendly,&rdquo; what does it do?&nbsp; It stamps a pink ribbon on its widget and proclaims that some miniscule portion of the profits will go to breast cancer research. I&rsquo;ve even seen a bottle of Shiraz called &ldquo;Hope&rdquo; with a pink ribbon on its label, but no information, alas, on how much you have to drink to achieve the promised effect. When Laura Bush traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2007, what grave issue did she take up with the locals? Not women&rsquo;s rights (to drive, to go outside without a man, etc.), but &ldquo;breast cancer awareness.&rdquo; In the post-feminist United   States, issues like rape, domestic violence, and unwanted pregnancy seem to be too edgy for much public discussion, but breast cancer is all apple pie.</p>

<p>So welcome to the Women&rsquo;s Movement 2.0: Instead of the proud female symbol -- a circle on top of a cross -- we have a droopy ribbon. Instead of embracing the full spectrum of human colors -- black, brown, red, yellow, and white -- we stick to princess pink. While we used to march in protest against sexist laws and practices, now we race or walk &ldquo;for the cure.&rdquo; And while we once sought full &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; of all that oppresses us, now we&rsquo;re content to achieve &ldquo;awareness,&rdquo; which has come to mean one thing -- dutifully baring our breasts for the annual mammogram.</p>
<p>Look, the issue here isn&rsquo;t health-care costs. If the current levels of screening mammography demonstrably saved lives, I would say go for it, and damn the expense. But the numbers are increasingly insistent: Routine mammographic screening of women under 50 <em>does not</em> reduce breast cancer mortality in that group, nor do older women necessarily need an annual mammogram. In fact, the whole dogma about &ldquo;early detection&rdquo; is shaky, as Susan Love <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-love23-2009nov23,0,1732820.story">reminds us</a>: &nbsp;the idea has been to catch cancers early, when they&rsquo;re still small, but some tiny cancers are viciously aggressive, and some large ones aren&rsquo;t going anywhere.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a title="http://www.alternet.org/reproductivejustice/144177/47,000_women_could_die_as_a_result_of_the_new_mammogram_guidelines/One" href="http://www.alternet.org/reproductivejustice/144177/47%2C000_women_could_die_as_a_result_of_the_new_mammogram_guidelines/" target="_blank">One response</a></span> to the new guidelines has been that numbers don&rsquo;t matter -- only individuals do -- and if just one life is saved, that&rsquo;s good enough. So OK, let me cite my own individual experience. In 2000, at the age of 59, I was diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer on the basis of one dubious mammogram followed by a really bad one, followed by a biopsy.&nbsp; Maybe I should be grateful that the cancer was detected in time, but the truth is, I&rsquo;m not sure whether these mammograms detected the tumor or, along with many earlier ones, contributed to it: One known environmental cause of breast cancer is radiation, in amounts easily accumulated through regular mammography.</p>
<p>And why was I bothering with this mammogram in the first place? I had long ago made the decision not to spend my golden years undergoing cancer surveillance, but I wanted to get my Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) prescription renewed, and the nurse practitioner wouldn&rsquo;t do that without a fresh mammogram.</p>
<p>As for the HRT, I was taking it because I had been convinced, by the prevailing medical propaganda, that HRT helps prevent heart disease and Alzheimer&rsquo;s. In 2002, we found out that HRT is itself a risk factor for breast cancer (as well as being ineffective at warding off heart disease and Alzheimer&rsquo;s), but we didn&rsquo;t know that in 2000. So did I get breast cancer because of the HRT -- and possibly because of the mammograms themselves -- or did HRT lead to the detection of a cancer I would have gotten anyway?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I do know that that biopsy was followed by the worst six months of my life, spent bald and barfing my way through chemotherapy. This is what&rsquo;s at stake here: Not only the possibility that some women may die because their cancers go undetected, but that many others will lose months or years of their lives to debilitating and possibly unnecessary treatments.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be suffering from &ldquo;chemobrain&rdquo; (chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline) to discern evil, iatrogenic, profit-driven forces at work here.&nbsp; In <a href="http://www.alternet.org/healthwellness/144053/do_yearly_mammograms_save_women%27s_lives/?page=3">a recent column</a> on the new guidelines, patient-advocate Naomi Freundlich raises the possibility that &ldquo;entrenched interests -- in screening, surgery, chemotherapy and other treatments associated with diagnosing more and more cancers -- are impeding scientific evidence.&rdquo; I am particularly suspicious of the oncologists, who saw their incomes soar starting in the late 80s when they began administering and selling chemotherapy drugs themselves in their ghastly, pink-themed, &ldquo;chemotherapy suites.&rdquo; Mammograms recruit women into chemotherapy, and of course, the pink-ribbon cult recruits women into mammography.</p>

<p>What we really need is a new women&rsquo;s health movement, one that&rsquo;s sharp and skeptical enough to ask all the hard questions: What are the environmental (or possibly life-style) <em>causes</em> of the breast cancer epidemic? Why are existing treatments like chemotherapy so toxic and heavy-handed? And, if the old narrative of cancer&rsquo;s progression from &ldquo;early&rdquo; to &ldquo;late&rdquo; stages no longer holds, what <em>is</em> the course of this disease (or diseases)? What we don&rsquo;t need, no matter how pretty and pink, is a ladies&rsquo; auxiliary to the cancer-industrial complex.</p>
