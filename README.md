# News Digest

## A Trashcan News Aggregator

> It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper. -- Jerry Seinfeld

This project was a spawned from how pissed off news sites made me 10 years ago. All I wanted was headlines, but they were shoveling a bunch of garbage at me.  To counter that, NewsDigest was born.

All it does is parse rss feeds and chuck back title links.

That's it. That's all I ever wanted from a news feed.

Cache times are screwed up, so... yea.

You need PHP to run this.
yes.
im sorry.



### Installation is EZ

```bash
composer install
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt
```

If you futz with the css, just run `grunt` again to re-minifize it. That's why grunt is there.

Good Luck,
Neo
